# Mugging Mod for GTA V by VideoWarfare

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the advanced Mugging Mod script for GTA V, enhancing the gaming experience by introducing more dynamic and realistic interactions during mugging scenarios. Players can now face NPCs with unpredictable behaviors, adding depth and engagement to the gameplay.

## Features
- **Dynamic NPC Interactions:** Initiate a mugging with any NPC, who may either comply or resist.
- **Randomized Outcomes:** NPCs can resist by engaging in combat or comply by surrendering money.
- **Realistic Consequences:** Mugged NPCs drop a variable amount of money and are marked to avoid repetition.

## Installation
1. Confirm that Script Hook V and all prerequisites are up to date.
2. Transfer the `Mugging Mod.dll` into the `scripts` folder within your GTA V directory.

## Usage
Aim at any pedestrian to start a mugging. Depending on the NPC's reaction, they might fight back or drop money. Successfully mugged NPCs will flee and be temporarily immune to further mugging attempts.

## Acknowledgments
This script represents a significant milestone in my modding journey, offering a more profound interaction mechanic within GTA V. The feedback and support from the community have been critical in developing this mod.

## Disclaimer
This mod is crafted for educational and entertainment purposes within the scope of GTA V's modding policy. Please engage with it responsibly.

## Future Work
- **Enhanced NPC Reactions:** Broadening the range of NPC behaviors to include seeking help or negotiating.
- **Mugged NPC Tracking:** Developing a system to monitor the mugged status of NPCs, allowing for status resets.
- **Increased Player Consequences:** Incorporating potential repercussions based on the reactions of bystanders or law enforcement.

Thank you for your interest in the Mugging Mod. I am eager to continue its development and contribute to the GTA modding community.
