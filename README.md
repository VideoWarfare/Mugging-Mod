# GTA V Mugging Mod Script

## Overview
This repository contains a script for a simple mugging mod in GTA V, developed as part of my initial foray into GTA V scripting. The script enables the player to mug NPCs by aiming at them, triggering a scripted interaction that ends with the player gaining money.

While I am still learning the nuances of GTA V scripting and mod development, I hope that this script can serve as a foundation or source of inspiration for others embarking on their own GTA modding projects.

## Features
- Players can initiate a mugging by simply aiming at an NPC.
- Successfully mugged NPCs cannot be mugged again, preventing exploitation.
- Adds a realistic and interactive layer to the GTA V world.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Script Hook V installed.
2. Copy the `Muggind Mod.dll` file into your `scripts` folder within your GTA V installation directory.

## Usage
Once in-game, you can trigger the mugging sequence by aiming at any pedestrian. If the mugging is successful, you will receive $500, and the NPC will flee, ensuring they cannot be mugged again immediately.

## Acknowledgments
As one of my first GTA V scripts, this project represents my initial steps into the world of game modding. The learning curve has been steep, but immensely rewarding. I encourage feedback and constructive criticism to help me improve.

I hope this script can assist or inspire anyone interested in creating their own GTA mods, regardless of their experience level.

## Disclaimer
This mod is intended for educational and entertainment purposes only. Please use responsibly and adhere to the game's modding policies.

## Future Work
- Enhance NPC reactions and add variability to the mugging outcomes.
- Introduce a cooldown period before the same NPC can be mugged again.
- Implement additional player consequences to balance the risk-reward dynamic.

Thank you for your interest in this mod, and happy modding!
